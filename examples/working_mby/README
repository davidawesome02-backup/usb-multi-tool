How to use the bl808 based USB passthrough:

    FLASHING -
        `make CHIP=bl808 BOARD=bl808dk CPU_ID=m0` -- Generate the build files and compile
        `timeout -k 19 17 make flash CHIP=bl808 BOARD=bl808dk CPU_ID=m0 COMX=/dev/ttyUSB0` -- Flash on /dev/ttyUSB0, with 2M baud
        `python3 generate_uf2.py "./build/build_out/usbd_msc_ram_bl808_m0.bin" "./output.uf2"` -- Read compiled files and write a working uf2 for the flash mode

    Mode definitions - 
        The main system is controlled with 5 pins;
            1-4 binary image selector
            5 Special button
LED
        Switching 1-4 will change the current mode
        In mode 0, your whole sd card will be passed through
        When in mode 0, pressing the special button for 5 seconds will cause it to repartition the sd card or check and resize image files


        Pin definitions:
            -----
                Default state high, pull to ground to switch

                6,7,30,31   -   Used to select mode, will be read in binary as 0b[6][7][30][31] - Pin31 is D0, Pin30 is D1, Pin7 is D2, and Pin 6 is D3.
                28          -   Special button pin
            -----

            -----
                LED
                23,22,21    - used to set LED color. Will pull high to 3.3v when enabled. To set the bits active, you must pull them high to 3.3V.
                    23      - Red
                    22      - Green
                    21      - Blue
            -----

        Color meanings (general operation):
            Red     -   Error
            Green   -   Good, working as expected
            Blue    -   Working / processing

    Using programs
        Specify your hid program file in your config.ini

        to use USB operations, start with below code, to avoid problems with USB not connecting instantly
        ```
        hi
        wu
        gs 1000
        ```

        commands:
        hi - hid init
        hd - hid disable
        wu - wait USB connection
        gs - general sleep      -   <ms>
        gj - general jump       -   <delta_lines>
        ls - LED set            -   <red> <green> <blue> // All are eithor 0 or 1, use 1 for on, 0 for off
        ks - keyboard string    -   <modifiers> <resend_count> <string>
        ki - keyboard input     -   <type> <resend_count> <modifiers> [data]{x6} // Type is 0 for hid codes and 1 for ascii characters as data
        mi - mouse input        -   <x> <y> <scroll> <buttons>
        
        // NEW in October 2023
        cj - conditional jump   -   <delta_lines>


How cache mode works
    Files used:
        images/cache_table.bin
        images/cache_buffer.bin
    
    These files are used to describe how the ox64 should forward reads at any given time;
    cache_table.bin -   the format is stored in little endian, using a 4 byte structure at any given time.
                        When a read request comes in with caching on, we jump into this file at the sector provided being multiplied by 4.
                        We then read 4 bytes, and get the offset in cache buffer.bin where we read the actual data.
                        If this value returned was 0, we instead read from the original file

    Cache_buffer.bin-   Stored as raw binary data, in chunks of blocksize as defined in the config, will be read at offsets provided by cache_table.bin


    Both these files can be removed at any time, they are only used and created at run time.



Getting started
-    1   -   Connect a multi color LED, or 3 colored leds with pins 23 for red VCC, 22 for green, and 21 for blue
-    2   -   Plug in a sd card
-    3   -   If the sd card is not blank, you can start reading when in mode 0.
-    4   -   If you are in mode 0 and want to use any functions other than USB pass through; hold the special button for 5 seconds
-    5   -   When it turns blue, wait until it turns back to green; this will mean partitioning and config creation suceeded.
-    6   -   If the USB is still connected, you will see the new files after it is remounted
-    7   -   Upload images in place of the temp ISO files created; you can change the config.ini to use their name or rename the files
-    8   -   It is suggested to unmount before changing modes if you made any changed, but this is not required in any way. It will most likely be fine
-    9   -   If your image is not passing through as a valid image, check if it is a ISO 9660 image, if it is, instead, folow step 10, then read *
-    10  -   To force a resize of the image provieded, in your config file specify the size you wish to use in blocks. Thisblock size|will be multiplied to get your total count.


--    Use a program like rufus to flash the ISO in ISO 9660 format to the device while in a non 0 mode, you should specify a size sutable for this to be done. Rufus will convert the ISO 9660 to a raw image that can be read with 'dd'.
